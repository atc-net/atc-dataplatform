# This step provisions all service principals.
# The following SPN are used:
#  - AtcGithubPipe - Not provisioned here.
#      Created in the separate script setup_deploying_SPN.ps1, this SPN is supposed to
#      act as close as possible to the the human that may want to run this pipeline.
#      Keeping this 1-1 correspondence take some effort becuase SPNs can do some things
#      that humans cannot. It is up to the developer to avoid these problems. The
#      benefit of this design philosopy is that the entire pipeline can be tested
#      locally.
#  - AtcDbSpn
#      This SPN is made a contributor to the temporary resource group. With this right,
#      the SPN can pull an access token to deploy jobs etc to databricks. This is not
#      possible for humans. Keeping with the design principle above, we do not use the
#      deploying SPN for this.
#  - AtcMountSpn
#      This SPN has only one right - access to the storage account. The secret of this
#      SPN is exposed inside databricks where mistakes or malicious behavior may expose
#      it. With this secret, an attacker must not gain the ability to deploy jobs or
#      resources, hence the restricted rights.
#
# Both the AtcDbSpn and the AtcMountSpn exists only once across multiple runs.
